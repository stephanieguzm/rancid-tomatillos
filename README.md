## Overview
for this project, the goal was to create a React application that allows users to browse through a collection of films and see what peaks their interest!  Users can click on a specific film and view a film details.  The user can use the functional back arrow or click the home button to return to the home page.

- `cd` into the root directory
- Run `npm install` in your command line to install the necessary dependencies
- Do NOT run `npm audit fix --force`
- Then type `npm start` . This runs the app in the development mode.
- Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
- The browser should then deploy using a local host
