### [Deployed Project Link](https://rancid-tomatillos-fawn.vercel.app/)

## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a React application that allows users to browse through a collection of films and see what piques their interest!  Users can click on a specific film and view a film's details.  The user can use the browsers forward and back arrows or click the home button/Rancid Tomatillo logo to return to the home page.  We have added in error handling for server side errors.

## Project Context
We are Mod 3 students in the Front-End Program at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://frontend.turing.edu/). Rancid Tomatillos is our first React application.

Learning Goals for this project included:      
✔️ Gain competency with React fundamentals      
✔️ Learn how to test React components & asynchronous JS using Cypress <br>
✔️ Create a multi page UX using React Router
